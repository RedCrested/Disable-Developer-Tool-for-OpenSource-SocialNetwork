# Disable Developer Tool Window and Right Click

Implementation of [disble-devtool](https://github.com/theajack/disable-devtool) library into OSSN. The 
disable-devtool disables all access to the devtools, preventing 'code porting' via the devtools

This library has the following features:

- Support configurable whether to disable the right-click menu
- Disable shortcut keys such as f12 and ctrl+shift+i
- Support recognition to open developer tools from browser menu bar and close the current page
- Developers can bypass the disable (url parameters are encrypted with tk and md5)
- Multiple monitoring modes, support almost all browsers (IE, 360, qq browser, FireFox, Chrome, Edge...)
- Highly configurable, minimalist to use, compact
- Identify the real mobile terminal and the browser developer tool to set the plug-in forged mobile terminal to save performance for the mobile terminal
- Support for identifying developer tools close events
- Support configurable whether to disable selection, copy, cut, paste function
- Support to identify eruda and vconsole debugging tools


## How to setup the options

After enabling the component, open the Disable Developer Tool option in the Config menu and set the options as you wish.

## Limitations

The component was tested in OSSN 6.1 and 6.4, free and premium versions. Maybe some adjustments are required in older versions. In this case, **use at your own risk**.
